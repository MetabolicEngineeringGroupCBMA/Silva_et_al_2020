# Silva et al. 2020

This repository has a collection of Jupyter notebooks describing cloning strategies
used in the publication:  **Silva et al. 2020 (link to paper)**

The following notebooks can be found in this repository:


[pYPK7_TEF1_RPS7B](notebooks/pYPK7_TEF1_RPS7B.ipynb) Yeast expression vector with TEF1 promoter and KanMX4 marker.
This vector was used as a source for the promoter and terminator for the pLBL2 and pLBL3 plasmids.


[pLBL2](notebooks/pLBL2.ipynb) Yeast expression vector with TEF1 promoter, RPS7B terminator and a URA3 marker.


[pLBL3](notebooks/pLBL3.ipynb) Same as pLBL2 but with the URA3 marker replaced by a LEU2 marker.


[pLBL3_PiXI_opt](notebooks/pLBL3_PiXI_opt.ipynb)


[pLBL3_XI](notebooks/pLBL3_XI.ipynb)


[pYPK0_XTTRRG](notebooks/pYPK0_XTTRRG.ipynb)


These notebooks are tested monthly on a Linux continuous integration server hosted by Travis CI:

For each Jupyter notebook file, there is a html version with the same name but with a
 `.html` extension instead of `.ipynb`. These files are static and can be viewed with any
modern web browser.
